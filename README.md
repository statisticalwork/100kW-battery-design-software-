The script now:

Lets the user to choose a specific electrode and electrolyte (via chosen_electrode and chosen_electrolyte) and the plates dimensions 

Simulates only that selected combination over various plate sizes, gaps, and cell counts

Outputs performance and endurance data

Generates and saves four plots in the folder kapitza_battery_plots/: csv output and plot

Energy vs Power

Resistance vs Discharge Duration

Power by Plate Area

Charge Time by Cells

Here are two sample plots generated by the interactive Kapitza battery simulator:

1. Energy Capacity vs Power Output

Shows how increasing cell count and plate surface boosts both energy and power

Plate gap affects performance (color coded)



2. Resistance vs Discharge Duration

Shows how internal resistance influences how long a burst can be sustained

Grouped by number of cells (color coded)
